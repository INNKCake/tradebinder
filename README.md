Simple python program to generate 4x3 binders of cards from you .csv

Thanks to Vitalyi Krytov for inspiration.


It uses sryfall.com as card image source.

.csv file should be in the same directory as binary/source code.

The syntax of .csv file should be Card+Name;SET (see example).

Current version is for test, so expect bugs and errors.
